# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the Civil Engineering department at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on studying safety and cyber-security in the in intelligent transportation systems. In the context of safety I focus on how to use formal verification and control theory to create algorithms with mathematical gaurantees of safety, which I have applied to the design of control of automated vehicles. My work on cyber-security has focused on developing tools for studying the extent to which automated vehicles could be used as attack vectors against broader traffic flows.


My advisor is [Professor Daniel Work](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/). I recieved a B.S. is in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2019. In 2020 I was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to study high reliance traffic control with automated vehicles.
