# Analyzing commercially available ACC vehicles for string-stability.

This work investigated answering whether or not commerically available adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles operate under string-stable control. This was a property that had been asserted in a number of works, but had previously not been verified. 

We tested 8 commercially available 2018 vehicles across three manufacturers, with over 1000 miles of total driving data collected. We found across all vehicles that they did not engage in car-following behavior that was string-stable. As a result, this means that just as humans contribute to phantom traffic jams, so do commerically available ACCs.

In following work we also developed techniques for performing online system-identification of ACC car-following dynamics. We developed both a technique that utilized a recursive least-squares filter as well as a particle filter to do identification and found both techniques to be both accurate and operational in real time.
